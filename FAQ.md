# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why are some events not showing up?

You must have at least one Facebook or Messenger tab open at any time for the extension to work.

Furthermore, it appears that some devices simply do not send the `typ` event the application listens to. Try it for yourself: if you can't see the typing status indicator (the bubble with three animated dots) while one of your friends is writing to you in a conversation, then neither can the app.

To make sure the application is correctly working for you, I recommend writing to yourself using the Messenger iOS app while having a Facebook or Messenger tab open on your desktop.

If you've tried out all the previous steps and still can't see anything, then something might be broken with the extension. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/Morhaus/facebook-sixth-sense/issues) and I'll take a look at it as soon as I can.
